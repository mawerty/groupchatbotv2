# gcbotv2
poorly coded bot that works on group chats, not for python noobs :)

# why? cuz discord broke shit and my old 1 no longer works


usage:
download python, in installation check the install to path box

open cmd and run python get-pip.py
open cmd in the path you have the extracted gcbot in and run "pip install -r requirements.txt"


edit the code with anything, scroll down until you find the token variable. Replace its content with your own USER account, preferably make a alt and get its token, if you dont know how theres videos of that on youtube.

open the python file

and the bot should run, to use it add it as a friend and add it to a group chat


done!
